The commands and examples used in IRCPhone.
IMPORTANT: Do not accidentally flood you BOT. It might stop receiving messages!!

Launching in terminal:
./irc_bot {ip/server} {channel} {user} {password}

- ip/server : ip address or domain of the IRC server.
- channel : channel on the server where the user will be present.
- user : Nick of the user the bot shall listen to. Nick of the bot therefore will be "user_b".
- password : Bots password. Might be redundant.

After the Hello! message you are able to use these commands. The bot shall ALWAYS give the user feedback in a form of a short message.

- register {-a <name>} | {<uri> <password>}
    - Registers at a proxy with provided uri and password. You are also able to register with uri and password
      stored at the database using -a and unique <name>.

    - example: register sip:username@domain password or register -a joe

- unregister
    - Unregisters at the proxy.

- call {-a <name>} | {-e <number>} | {<uri>}
    - Initiates a call to <uri>. If you have the person stored in your contacts you might use -a <name>.
    - Also you are able to make peer-to-peer calls with sip:username@ip-address
    - The ENUM lookup is also available with argument -e. Just type the phone number.

    -example: call sip:username@domain or call -a john or call -e +431123456789

- accept {<number>}
    - User is informed if an incoming call comes. User then might accept this call by typing accept <number> where
      <number> is the order of the call in which the call comes. The order is diplayed to the user. All other active incoming
      calls are declined.

- decline
    - Decline an incoming call/calls.

- status
    - Displays current status of the bot. If it's registered, if it's in an active call, the list of all calls (paused and active) and whether 
      STUN or TRUN is enabled.

- help {<option>}
    - Displays list of all usable commands. Use <option> for a command category.
    - Options   1. o - options
                2. c - call commands
                3. r - register commands
                4. m - direct messages commands
                5. a - address book commands
                6. dl - database list commands (contacts/proxy ids browsing)

    - example: help o

- -s {<address>} [-t {<username>} {<passw>}]
    - Enables ICE, STUN and sets the address of the STUN/TURN server (-s) and if desired enables TURN and authenticates at the
      TURN server with provided <username> and <password> (-t). The -t argument is optional.

    - example: -s stun.domain.com -t username password

- end
    - Terminates the bot.

- mess {-a <name>} {<text>} | {<uri>} {<text>}
    - Sends a direct message to the given <uri>. If the remote is in contacts the user may use -a <name>.

    -examle: mess -a johnny Hey how are you? or mess sip:username@domain Hey how are you?

When a call is initiated, you may also use these additional commands:

- hold
    - Puts the current call on hold.

- resume 
    - Resumes the current call.

- hangup
    - Hangs up the current call.

- -m {text}
    - Sends a direct message to the user you are in call with.

On the other hand, these are not available during call:
- register, unregister, -s -t, end

NOTE: Bot can also be terminated by CTRL+C in terminal.

Address book commands are ubiquitous and their role is to manage your contacts or proxy identities.
The database is open since the bot's launch on server.
NOTE: All <name> attributes ARE unique within the database!

- -dropdb
    - Drops the tables.

- -c 
    - Creates the tables.

- -ic {<name>} {<uri>}
    - Inserts new contact.

    - example: -ic JohnDoe sip:john@domain

- -ir {<name>} {<uri>} {<password>}
    - Inserts new proxy identity used for registering.

    - example: -ir MyProxy sip:myname@domain mypassword

- -uc {<name>} {<uri>}
    - Updates contact. Must already exist.

    - example: -uc JohnDoe sip:NewUri@domain

- -ur {<name>} {<uri>} {<password>}
    - Updates identity. Must already exist. If you wish to not update an attribute, type "-" instead.

    - example: -ur MyNewId sip:NewUri@domain newPassw
    - If you want to update just password: -ur MyNewId - newPassw

- -rc {<name>} or -rr {<name>}
    - Removes a record from contacts (-rc) or from proxy identity (-rr) respectively.

Also the user is able to browse its contacts/identities:

- -con [<pattern>]
    - Browse contacts. The pattern is standard sqlite regex with % and _ wildcards. 

    - example: -con joh% will search for records starting with joh and ending with any number of random characters.

- -reg [<pattern>]
    - Browse proxy identities. Same rules for patter as in -con command.

- next [<number>]
    - While in browsing mode you can turn to next page by typing this command. You can skip a certain
      number of pages by providing a <number>. By default its 1.

- prev [<number>]
    - Turns to previous page. <number> argument has the same rules as in "next" command.

- exit
    - Exits the browsing mode.

NOTE: No other commands than next, prev and exit are available. You must leave the browsing mode first.
      If in an active call the user is still able to keep calling.
